### 👨‍💻 Introduction:
- The project is designed to tokenize the text "Steve Jobs 2005 Commencement" in both English and Korean, analyzing word frequency in each language. In Korean, however, meaning is often conveyed without strict spacing rules, which can result in inconsistencies in word spacing. Therefore, stop words and tokenization settings may need to be customized by the user based on the text source.
For this project, we use KoNLPy, a Python package specifically designed for processing Korean text. KoNLPy includes several tools, notably Okt (Open Korea Text), an effective tokenizer and POS tagger that provides a range of functions essential for Korean natural language processing.
